    "# \"r\" - Read mode: This mode is used to read data from a file. The file must exist, otherwise a FileNotFoundError will be raised. When a file is opened in read mode, it cannot be modified.\n",
    "# \"w\" - Write mode: This mode is used to write data to a file. If the file exists, its contents will be overwritten. If the file does not exist, it will be created. When a file is opened in write mode, the contents of the file are deleted and replaced with the new data.\n",
    "# \"a\" - Append mode: This mode is used to append data to an existing file. If the file does not exist, it will be created. When a file is opened in append mode, new data is added to the end of the file, without overwriting the existing data.\n",
    "# \"x\" - Exclusive creation mode: This mode is used to create a new file, but raises a FileExistsError if the file already exists.\n",
    "# \"b\" - Binary mode: This mode is used to read or write binary data, such as images or executable files.\n",
    "# \"t\" - Text mode: This mode is used to read or write text data, such as strings or characters. This is the default mode if no mode is specified.\n",
